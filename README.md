Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and some modified PSO (mPSO) algorithm.

The main files are: [1] Tugas_PSO_Opt.m; and [2] Tugas_mPSO_MT1D.m

The first file is the standard PSO algorithm applied to several "Testing Functions" such as Peaks, Sphere, Rastrigin, Griewank, and Schaffer while the second file is an mPSO algorithm implemented to the Magnetotelluric (MT) 1-D inversion.
